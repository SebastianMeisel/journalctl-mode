* Introduction
  This Emacs major mode is designed for viewing the output from systemd's journalctl within Emacs. It provides a convenient way to interact with journalctl logs, including features like fontification, chunked loading for performance, and custom keyword highlighting.

* Installation
  To install, place =journalctl-mode.el= in your load-path and add the following to your .emacs file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'journalctl-mode)
  #+END_SRC

  Alternatively, you can install =journalctl-mode= using the =use-package= macro with Quelpa for automatic installation from the GitHub repository:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package journalctl-mode
  :ensure t)
  #+END_SRC

* Define a global key

It might be a good idea to define a global key to journalctl with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") 'journalctl)
#+END_SRC

or with use-package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package journalctl-mode
  :ensure t
  :bind (("C-c t" . journalctl)))
#+END_SRC


* Features
  - Fontification: Customize the appearance of log levels with faces.
  - Chunked Loading: Load journalctl output in manageable chunks for better performance.
  - Keyword Highlighting: Define custom keywords for error, warning, and other log levels.
  - Follow Mode: Simulate tail -f functionality to keep up with new log entries.

* Usage
  Once installed, =journalctl-mode= can be invoked with =M-x journalctl=.
  The mode provides a transient interface for journalctl command-line options, allowing for dynamic and flexible log viewing.

* Customization
  Customize the mode to your liking by setting the following variables:

  - =journalctl-chunk-size=: Number of lines per chunk (default 250).
  - =journalctl-error-keywords=: List of keywords to highlight as errors.
  - =journalctl-warn-keywords=: List of keywords to highlight as warnings.
  - =journalctl-starting-keywords=: Keywords for starting processes.
  - =journalctl-finished-keywords=: Keywords for finished processes.
  - =journalctl-follow-freq=: Frequency for updating in follow mode.
  - =journalctl-follow-lines=: Number of lines to show in follow mode.
  - =journalctl-default-options:= List of default options for journalctl on start.

* Key Bindings
  | Key   | Action                             |
  |-------+------------------------------------|
  | n     | Load next chunk of journalctl output |
  | p     | Load previous chunk of journalctl output |
  | C-v   | Scroll up in the buffer             |
  | M-v   | Scroll down in the buffer           |
  | q     | Quit journalctl mode                |

* Other Packages
There is another package [[https://github.com/WJCFerguson/journalctl][journalctl]] (rather than journalctl-mode) by James Ferguson that fetches and interleaves JSON data using multiple simultaneous asynchronous journalctl queries, while mine offers a UI for query-building and chunked synchronous data loading.
